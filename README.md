# tic-tac-toe
This is a tic-tac-toe game developed in Java language.
It uses java.awt package for container and component classes.
It also imports java.awt.event package, to handle the events happening on the event sources(Actually to respond to the user's interaction with the buttons).
For checking the winner on each clicks, we have used two-dimensional arrays with simple conditional and looping structures.
It uses a message dialog from java.swing package, to show the result of the game.
There are three results of each game- 
1. X is the WINNER
2. O is the WINNER
3. Game Draw
